Right now, I'm most interested in Full Stack Development, and I have a passion for solving Data Structure and Algorithm problems. I always strive to maintain a learning mindset; every day, I wake up with the goal of learning something new. Apart from my academic interests, I also enjoy listening to music, and occasionally, I try my hand at singing (ðŸ˜‚). My musical taste leans towards older classics, like 'Lag Ja Gale' and songs by Kishore Da. Thank you!
